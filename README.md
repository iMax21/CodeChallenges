# CodeChallenges 📚

Welcome to the **CodeChallenge** repository! Here, you'll find a curated collection of coding exercises, challenges, and problem-solving sessions that I’m working on across different programming languages. The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey, improve my algorithmic thinking, and showcase my solutions to a variety of coding challenges.


## 🚀 Purpose
This repository is my personal "workout log" for coding exercises. Here, I’ll be tracking my progress, experimenting with new languages, and tackling problems from beginner to advanced levels. Each solution is crafted with clarity and efficiency in mind, and the repository is organized to make it easy for anyone to navigate through the code and find inspiration for their own practice.


## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by exercise rather than languages.


## 📈 Progress Tracking

I’m using this repository as a way to track my coding progress. Here’s a quick view of how it’s going:

| Language     | Challenges Solved | Last Updated  |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Python       | 0                | n/a           |
